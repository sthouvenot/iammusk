Good catch, net worth is used for the CEOs, and net income is used for others. If we used income for all, Jeff Bezos would actually make $81,840 a year. Net worth is defined as "the value of all assets, minus the total of all liabilities". Therefore, it is important to note that there is a clear distinction between these two numbers. One is personal income, while one includes how much of a company someone owns. Jeff Bezos does not receive $3,000 every second in his bank account that he can spend, instead this number shows that Amazon is improving.

However, the majority of American's net worth rely more on income other than a company they own. Therefore, I believe it is fair, even for those in the top 1 or top .1 percent, that we can increase one's net worth by their income. This tool is not perfect, but my main goal is to give a visual representation of how much some of our top CEO's make and comparing that number with our own.
