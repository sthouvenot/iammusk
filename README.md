On this webpage, I've undertaken a comparison between the net worth of CEOs and the average income of Americans. The rationale behind utilizing 'net worth' for CEOs and 'income' for average Americans stems from the distinctive financial nature of these two groups.

For CEOs, 'net worth' is employed as a measurement due to the complexity of their financial standing. Net worth encapsulates the overall value of their assets minus any liabilities, offering a comprehensive view of their financial holdings. This figure is especially relevant for CEOs as it considers their ownership stakes in companies and various investment portfolios.

On the other hand, when evaluating average Americans, using 'income' provides a clearer depiction of their financial situation. 'Income' signifies the earnings generated over a specific period, typically on an annual basis. This is more appropriate for individuals who primarily rely on salaries, wages, and other income sources rather than substantial ownership in companies.

In essence, the distinction between 'net worth' for CEOs and 'income' for average Americans ensures a fair and accurate comparison. It takes into account the distinct financial dynamics of these two groups, providing a balanced representation of their respective financial standings.
